# Easy-Estimation Interface

Easy-Estimation Interface is a program designed to speed up the estimate process for home painting projects. It provides an interface for users to input measurements and select different paint qualities, and outputs the estimated cost for both supplies and labor.

## How to Use

To use Easy-Estimation Interface, simply input the necessary measurements and select the desired paint quality. The program will automatically calculate the estimated cost for supplies and labor based on the input data. The output will be displayed in an easy-to-read table format.

## Inputs

Easy-Estimation Interface accepts integer inputs, as well as a paint selection. Once prompted, users can choose from different paint qualities and input measurements for the size of the project.

## Functions

Easy-Estimation Interface utilizes two user functions: `calculatePaint(measurement)` and `calculateLabor(measurement)`.

`calculatePaint(measurement)` takes an inputted measurement from a specified area, calculates how many gallons of paint are needed, and provides pricing for the selected option.

`calculateLabor(measurement)` is similar, but instead outputs the total cost for labor.

## Benefits

Easy-Estimation Interface can save time for estimate processes for home painting projects. It is estimated that this program can save 10 minutes for each estimate, and with over 50,000 estimates done nationally each year, that amounts to over 8,000 man-hours saved.

## Future Updates

There are no current updates planned for Easy-Estimation Interface. If any updates become available, they will be added to this README file with the date and a brief description of the update. If you are using different standards for labor or paint pricing, options can be updated in the laborRate and paintPrices indices.
